    <!-- WRITE YOUR LETTER HERE -->
    To You,<br><br>
    HAPPY BIRTHDAY SOUP:)
You turned EIGHTEEN yayyyaayyay!!
I dont know what to say where to start, these days my brain is lil messed up too, should have written the letter before exams!
first of all i am kind of replyin to your msgs late these days so im sorry for that.
Next is i really really want to be there for you, ik you are in a deep shit rn, you are feeling n goin thru a lot more than anyone can ever imagine and me sayin its gonna be alright does no help so i try not to. But then again idk what else to say coz im not physically there ki bas chup hoke beth jaayen or mai tujhe apna shoulder dedun ki bhai sar rakhke ro le thoda. But even if im not there to actually see you i just know ki you have been strong. Every day you must trying to be fight, to stay strong and you hve been doing a great job, even if your brain is too messed up, even if you break with each passing day you must be trying to act tough. I cannot do much for you except these stupid things wishing it might make you happy even if just for a moment.
And i really really pray that everything gets better for you this year coz you deserve better.
I know its difficult but take care of yourself yea?
I am waiting for the Subh who made stupid jokes and listened to my rants and gave me gyan. The one who talked to me when i couldn't sleep and never got offended coz of my mood swings and all that. I hope you dont lose those parts of yourself.
For what its worth, im really grateful to have you in my life. And i am proud of you.

(p.s. ignore the grammatical errors coz i typed it in laptop)
